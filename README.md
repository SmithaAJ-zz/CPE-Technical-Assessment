# CPE-Technical-Assessment
 
This test to access ability to implement modern automated infrastructure, as well as best
practices around IaC, CI/CD, and coding. 
 
The following folder structure is followed:

./
├─ 1_infrastructure
│ └─project
├─ 2_automation
│ └─project
└─ 3_coding
└─ project

 
## 1. Infrastructure Test
 
Build out some basic Infrastructure for Azure, AWS, or GCP using tooling like ARM/Bicep
templates, Terraform, or CloudFormation that can be used in a repeatable way. Bonus points for
the following:
 
* Clearly explaining why you&#39;re doing things a certain way
* Providing a PNG diagram of your infrastructure
 
## 2. Automation Test
 
Creating a CI pipeline, using a tool of your choice, that deploys some infrastructure to a cloud
environment of your choice.
 
* Use a tool of your choice such as Github Actions, Azure DevOps, or even Bash or Python
scripts or similar to automate the installation of infrastructure
 
## 3. Coding Test
 
Build a basic tool in Python, Ruby, Node.js or another language of your choice that does
_something_ you&#39;d normally end up having to do manually. Some ideas:
 
* A basic API to provide you with some useful information
* Getting some information back from an external source and presenting it to the end user
